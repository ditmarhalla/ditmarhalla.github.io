This is a blog post that will continue. There will be no folders and new entries will just be the last post you see here.

I will mostly write about what I am working on and what fascinates me. The reason I wanted to start a blog is because I don't have anyone to talk about my passion. Astronomy, physics and science in general. As a teenager I use to read every article. Nowadays I cant finish an article. Because I cant share my passion with anyone.

So that is why I decided to write instead. In the hopes to lit again that little fire left in me. That has so much passion for science. If you have any suggestions or what to chat just hit me up. I really what to find people I can talk to in the hopes to re-find my passion for physics and science in general.
