This is a blog post that will continue. There will be no folders and new entries will just be the last post you see here.
I will mostly write about what I am working on and what fascinates me. The reason I wanted to start a blog is because I dont have anyone to talk about my passion. Astronomy, physics and science in general. As a teenager I use to read avery article. Nowadays I cant finish an article. Because I cant share my exitment with anyone.
So that is why I decidet to write instead. In the hopes to lit again that little fire left in me. That has so much passion for science. If you have any sugestion or whant to chat just hit me up. I really what to find people I can talk to in the hopes to refind my passion for physics and science in general.
