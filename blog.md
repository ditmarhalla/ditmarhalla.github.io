This is a blog post that will continue. There will be no folders and new entries will just be the last post you see here.

I will mostly write about what I am working on and what fascinates me. The reason I wanted to start a blog is because I don't have anyone to talk about my passion. Astronomy, physics and science in general. As a teenager I use to read every article. Nowadays I cant finish an article. Because I cant share my passion with anyone.

So that is why I decided to write instead. In the hopes to lit again that little fire left in me. That has so much passion for science. If you have any suggestions or what to chat just hit me up. I really what to find people I can talk to in the hopes to re-find my passion for physics and science in general.



# Switching to Linux

So this is a post about my experience with my migration to Linux. This is not my first time I have migrated from Windows to Linux. It's been a long time. But when Ubuntu 10.10 was out, that takes me back as I realize it has been 10 years, I did the same. At that time I was in high school. That was my first ever experience with Linux. But it was just curiosity. It did not last much and I moved back to Windows as I wanted to play games and Wine was not the best back then.

Then one year ago I had the chance to try linux again. As I installed git in order to commit my code to github in order to learn. I had to relearn some shell commands. Which made me realise how much I missed Linux. This is when I started thinking of switching to Linux for good. The opportunity presented itself when the course in Computational Fluid Dynamics required, that is the wrong word, it would be way easier to use Linux instead of Windows. So I decided to use a Virtual Machine. At first I installed Ubuntu again. As that's what the professor recommended. But because of my laptop as well as the virtualization it was painfully slow. 

After some research on the internet 'xfce' was recommended as a light wait Linux. So I got the Debian installer. As soon as I booted into Debian xfce I noticed how fast it was running. The interface was simple but it was more then okay as it was fast. Like it was running on a normal machine, not on a virtual machine. During this time I always was thinking of switching to Linux. All the time. I don't know what it was about Windows. I think it was more something about Linux.

I started working with High Performance Computing (HPC for short) and Windows was not making thing easy. At all. Just problem after problem so I used my Virtual Machine. But still even that was not working that well. File transfers where clumsy and also other things.

The problem with switching is always the problems that come with it. One of my friends said once that no need to brake something that is working. So if its working for you why bother trying something that makes life more difficult. I understood what he was saying. It does the job. Its just a tool in it's eyes. Why fix it if or try to make it better. That was me and Windows. He didn't what to switch to anything new. He had learned the software and used it for long. Learning something new would just make him waste time. He felt comfortable with his old tools. But I always was a tinkerer. Always remember trying all different software. Always tinkering. Even my friends that where very IT oriented didn't know about a lot of software that I know about. So that is probably what motivates me. I want to try new stuff. Simple as that.

Deep in me I know. You just have to make the move. And then live with it. You will adapt slowly. But in the back of my mind I was always thinking. It's working why do it. When I heard about Windows 11, I know. I had to make the switch soon. So one day I did it. I decided to switch and live with it. I deceded to go with Debian KDE. That was a mistake that I don't recommend anyone. I love Debian. But I am on a laptop. I am not an experienced Linux user. Had a lot of driver problems. Regretted deleting my Windows installation. Then I remembered. Ubuntu should be ok. It's not the best but it will do the job. So I did. Still ran into some problems. But in the end everything works and now after only 5 days I have the same setup that I had with Windows. Cant even feel the difference. Or I can. Its so much better. Don't know what it is about Linux. Or Ubuntu. Its so simple. No clutter. And so easy to run, install, manage things.

Now that I am writing this. Thinking back. Windows is so confusing. Options are so confusing. File system as well. In Linux everything is so well documented and the community is as well very, professional... Not the best word but I am going to go with it.

So that is my experience so far. Regret in the beginning. But now I am truly loving it. The simplicity I didn't realize I needed. I will of course try other distros. I know the community hates on Ubuntu a bit but its a really good option. I remember now trying Linux Mint as well a long time ago. But I don't know what it is about Ubuntu that I really like. I think it's the simplicity. So yeah. I am going to finish my rant now.
