I am an Applied Mathematics student. My interests are vast. From computer vision and image processing, to more hardware related projects like using a raspbery pi. I mostly use Python, as that is the language I have the most proficency in. But I am trying to learn C++, since I like to have knowledge in a langauge that is close to the hardware and also fast when I need it.

Curently I am working as a reasearch assistant with one of my professors at the university in High Performance Computing (HPC) for simulations. My work consists in runing simulations for fluid dynamics using Linux and some Shell scripting in order to automate the tasks. Feel free to check my [GitHub](https://github.com/ditmarhalla) to see what proeject I am working on.
