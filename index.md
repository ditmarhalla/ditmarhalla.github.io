I am an Applied Mathematics student. My interests are vast. From computer vision and image processing, to more hardware related like using a raspbery pi. I mostly use Python as that is th elanguage i have the most proficency in. But I am trying to learn C++ as I like to have knowledge in a langauge that is close to the hardware. Feel free to check my [GitHub](https://github.com/ditmarhalla) to see what proeject I am working on.
